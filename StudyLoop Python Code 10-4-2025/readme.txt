I have uploaded one folder containing three other folders. The two folders with programs can be run in their .sln files through Visual Studio.

StudyLoop Main Feed Controls opens a GUI that acts as the feed for StudyLoop.

StudyLoop Post Functions opens a GUI that allows the user to post to the main feed.

I recommend keeping them in the same folder for the programs to work. The post function adds posts to the database in the StudLoop Database folder, and these posts are displayed on the StudyLoop Main Feed Controls when run. StudyLoop Main Feed Controls also refreshes every five seconds, updating the displayed posts.
